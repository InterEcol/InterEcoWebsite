Hello and welcome to **InterEco**! Here you can learn how to build a free, interactive website to communicate the results of your ecological analysis. With InterEco, you can increase the impact of your research.Â 

**What is InterEco?**

\'InterEco\' is short for \'***inter***active ***eco***logy\'. It is a tool that helps you build an interactive web application that can be published for free alongside your ecological research article. It uses [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/#:~:text=Shiny%20is%20an%20R%20package,%2C%20htmlwidgets%2C%20and%20JavaScript%20actions.), an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web pages straight from R. With Shiny, you can make a slick website without having any experience in web development.

By making your own InterEco website, you will provide your audience (e.g., fellow ecologists, policymakers or practitioners) with personalised options to evaluate and interact with different aspects of the data, such as model predictions under user-specified conditions, or options to visualise the underlying data in different graphical formats. In doing so, your website can facilitate richer interpretation, improve research openness and increase the impact of your research.

InterEco websites have a basic structure, consisting of five separate tabs (see here \[link\] for more info, and here \[link\] for an example webpage):

1\) Study summary

2\)

3\) Interpretation - here you provide readers with xxx/ appropriate interpretation.

4\)

5\)

The InterEco tool comprises a detailed, step-by-step guide for making a website that follows this basic structure. To get started with your own model, you can either follow the guide \[link\], or jump to our guthib page \[link\] and download a shortened versionXXXX. Our detailed guide explains the rationale behind InterEco, and works with an example data set \[link download\]. We provide lots of hints and tips, with examples of code, which can be modified to suit your needs. You can also view an example InterEco webpage here \[link to worked example\].

**Why InterEco?**

Despite these advances, our presentation of model results in scientific publications has remained relatively unchanged for centuries, with scientific figures typically rendered as static, 2D images with a single x and y axis. Such simplistic presentations create missed opportunities for much richer interpretation, can conceal ecological complexity and even lead to erroneous conclusions.

InterEco can overcome these limitations by enabling users to select and directly interact with underlying
data and predictions generated by complex models. We foresee three major benefits of InterEco, in terms of improvements to:

1\) Interpretability -

2\) Generality -

3\) Validity -

**Who should use InterEco?**

InterEco is aimed at ecologists who fit statistical models to data, where the models involve nonlinear relationships (e.g., through fitting generalised linear models, polynomial terms) or statistical interactions (such as product terms). Your model might be relatively simple, e.g., a linear model with two predictors and their interaction, or a more complex generalised linear model with several predictors. Web pages produced via InterEco can be published alongside academic publicationsand project reports.
