Hello and welcome to InterEco! Here you can learn how to build a free, interactive website to effectively communicate the results of your ecological analysis.

**What is InterEco?**

'InterEco' is short for '***inter***active ***eco***logy'. It is a tool that helps you build an interactive website that can be published for free alongside your ecological research article. It uses [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/#:~:text=Shiny%20is%20an%20R%20package,%2C%20htmlwidgets%2C%20and%20JavaScript%20actions.), an R package that makes it easy to build interactive webpages straight from R. With Shiny, you can make a slick website without having any experience in web development (e.g. html, Java). InterEco websites produced via InterEco can be published alongside academic publications, project reports, or standalone.

With an InterEco website, you can present the results of your statistical analysis in an visual, interactive way. You can provide your audience (e.g., fellow ecologists, policymakers or practitioners) with personalised options to evaluate and interact with different aspects of your model and data, such as model predictions under user-specified conditions, or options to visualise the underlying data in different graphical formats. In doing so, your website can facilitate richer interpretation, improve research openness and increase the impact of your research.

The InterEco Tool consists of a set of detailed guidelines to help you build your website. InterEco websites have a basic structure, consisting of five separate tabs (see here \[link\] for more info, and here \[link\] for an example webpage):

1\) [Study summary]{.underline}

2\)

3\) [Interpretation]{.underline} - here you will guide your readers provide readers with xxx/ appropriate interpretation.

4\) [Generality]{.underline} - here

5\)

The InterEco Tool comprises a detailed, step-by-step guide for making your own InterEco website that follows this basic structure. \[**say it** **tells what you should think about and why..., based on statistical literature or good practice??**\]

To get started with your own model, you can either follow the guide \[link\], or jump to our github page \[link\] and download a shortened versionXXXX. Our guide explains the rationale behind InterEco, and works with an example data set \[link download\]. We provide lots of hints and tips, with example code, which can be modified to suit your needs and wishes. You can also view an example InterEco webpage here \[link to worked example\].

**Who should use InterEco?**

InterEco is aimed at ecologists who fit statistical models to data, where the models involve nonlinear relationships. For example, models may contain terms such as statistical interactions (product terms), polynomials, transformed variables, or may comprise generalized linear models with nonlinear link functions. Your model might be relatively simple, e.g., a linear model with two predictors and their interaction, or a more complex generalised linear model with several predictors.

**Why InterEco?**

The presentation of model results in scientific publications has remained relatively unchanged for centuries, with scientific figures typically rendered as static, 2D images with a single x and y axis. Such simplistic presentations create missed opportunities for much richer interpretation, can conceal ecological complexity and even lead to erroneous conclusions \[link to paper\].

It is time to break free from the constraints of 2D figures and **XXXX** \[**add** **some inspirational text that puts onus on the researcher to be good at story telling and open sci practice and not stop at scientific article or report??**\]

InterEco helps researchers tell stories with their models and data. With an InterEco website, audiences can select and directly interact with underlying data and predictions generated by complex models. We foresee three major benefits of InterEco, in terms of improvements to research interpretability, generality and validity.
